`bem-tools` is a toolkit for working with files based on [BEM methodology](https://bem.info/method/).

It allows you to:

* Create entities
* Build final runtime
* Work with build declarations: merge, subtract and intersect them
* Build the whole project using `bem make` command
* Launch development server on the project source tree using `bem server` command.
